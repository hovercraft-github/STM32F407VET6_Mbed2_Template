# STM32F407VET6_Mbed2_Template

This project is aimed to provide the starting point for creating Mbed-backed software for STM32F407VET6 boards, using sw4stm32 development environment.
It's originaly forked from here: https://os.mbed.com/users/hudakz/code/STM32F407VET6_Pong/.
The required Mbed sources are copied from here: https://github.com/ARM-software/mbed-beetle.
Then the procedure described here was applied to make it compatible with Eclipse/sw4stm32 IDE: https://www.openstm32.org/Importing%2Ban%2Bmbed%2Bprogram .
Finally, some adjustments was made, so it can be built & run under debugger.
<p>Hope, it can help somebody to pass that way.
